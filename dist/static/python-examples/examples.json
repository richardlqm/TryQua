    "description": "A CPMG sequence (or other parametric play loop) a CPMG sequence is a widely used pulse sequence, here used as example of parametric play with control flow capabilities. With QUA you can easily have a loop that plays hundreds or thousands of pulses in just two lines, and with the OPX a code to play 10 or 10 million pulses takes the same <1second to compile",

    "description": "controlling the phase difference between channels is often a major headache for qubit labs. Most multi-qubit operation will simply not work as intended if the phase is not precisely monitored. With the OPX, different channels get automatically the same phase, as phase is calculated and backtraced from the beginning of the sequence. This means that even if we change the frequency of a channel, when we get back to the original frequency the phase will be the same of the case in which frequency never changed. QUA offers full control over phase, in less than a line of code.",
